# Maximum-Total-Importance-of-Roads

You are given an integer n denoting the number of cities in a country. The cities are numbered from 0 to n - 1.

You are also given a 2D integer array roads where roads[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there exists a bidirectional road connecting cities ai and bi.

You need to assign each city with an integer value from 1 to n, where each value can only be used once. The importance of a road is then defined as the sum of the values of the two cities it connects.

Return the maximum total importance of all roads possible after assigning the values optimally.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 5, roads = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[0,2],[1,3],[2,4]]
Output: 43
Explanation: The figure above shows the country and the assigned values of [2,4,5,3,1].
- The road (0,1) has an importance of 2 + 4 = 6.
- The road (1,2) has an importance of 4 + 5 = 9.
- The road (2,3) has an importance of 5 + 3 = 8.
- The road (0,2) has an importance of 2 + 5 = 7.
- The road (1,3) has an importance of 4 + 3 = 7.
- The road (2,4) has an importance of 5 + 1 = 6.
The total importance of all roads is 6 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 7 + 6 = 43.
It can be shown that we cannot obtain a greater total importance than 43.

Example 2:

Input: n = 5, roads = [[0,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: 20
Explanation: The figure above shows the country and the assigned values of [4,3,2,5,1].
- The road (0,3) has an importance of 4 + 5 = 9.
- The road (2,4) has an importance of 2 + 1 = 3.
- The road (1,3) has an importance of 3 + 5 = 8.
The total importance of all roads is 9 + 3 + 8 = 20.
It can be shown that we cannot obtain a greater total importance than 20.
 
Constraints:

2 <= n <= 5 * 104
1 <= roads.length <= 5 * 104
roads[i].length == 2
0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1
ai != bi
There are no duplicate roads.

# SOLUTION

# Intuition 
The goal is to maximize the total importance of the roads by assigning importance values to cities. The importance of a road is the sum of the importance values of the two cities it connects. To achieve the maximum total importance, cities with more connections (higher degrees) should be assigned higher importance values.

# Approach 
Count Connections: Traverse the list of roads and count the number of connections (roads) each city has. This can be stored in an array where each index represents a city, and the value at that index represents the number of roads connected to that city.
Sort Connections: Sort the array of connection counts in ascending order. This allows us to assign the smallest importance values to the cities with the fewest connections and the largest importance values to the cities with the most connections.
Assign Importance: Initialize a variable cost to 1, representing the lowest importance value. Iterate through the sorted connections array, multiplying each value by the current cost, and add the result to the total importance. Increment cost after each multiplication.
Return Result: The total importance calculated in the previous step is the maximum importance of the roads.

# Complexity 
Time complexity: (O(n \log n + m)), where (n) is the number of cities and (m) is the number of roads. Sorting the connections array takes (O(n \log n)), and counting the connections takes (O(m)).
Space complexity: (O(n)), where (n) is the number of cities. This is due to the space needed to store the connections array.
Graph Example

The image shows an example of a graph with 5 cities and several roads connecting them. Hereâ€™s the detailed step-by-step approach based on the image:

# Count Connections:

City 0 has 3 connections: to cities 1, 2, and 3.
City 1 has 3 connections: to cities 0, 2, and 3.
City 2 has 4 connections: to cities 0, 1, 3, and 4.
City 3 has 3 connections: to cities 0, 1, and 2.
City 4 has 1 connection: to city 2.
Sort Connections:

The connections array before sorting: ([3, 3, 4, 3, 1]).
The connections array after sorting: ([1, 3, 3, 3, 4]).
Assign Importance:

Assign importance values starting from 1.
City with 1 connection gets importance 1.
Cities with 3 connections get importance 2, 3, and 4.
City with 4 connections gets importance 5.
Importance values assigned: ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]).
Calculate Total Importance:

Multiply the sorted connections by their assigned importance values and sum them up.
Total importance = (1 \times 1 + 3 \times 2 + 3 \times 3 + 3 \times 4 + 4 \times 5 = 1 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 20 = 48).


# JAVA CODE

class Solution
{

public long maximumImportance(int n, int[][] roads)
     {
          long res = 0, cost = 1;

          long[] conn = new long[n];

              for (int[] road : roads)
              {
                 conn[road[0]]++;

                 conn[road[1]]++;
              }

              Arrays.sort(conn);
              
              for (long con : conn)
              {
                   res += con * (cost++);
            
              }
               return res;
    }
}
